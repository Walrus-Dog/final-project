                    <p className="info-text">Some might ask the question. Why sell all this random junk? Well, it all started back in the day. Back when we were based out of grandma’s basement. We had all this junk lying around. NOw I know what you’re thinking, just have a yard sale. But I did one better. I had a VIRTUAL YARD SALE. And it was a smash hit. All the garbage and junk that was building up was gone and replaced with sweet sweet green. I knew this was the way to go.</p>
                    <p className="info-text">So we ran with it. We got a computer that wasn’t from 1998. Got ourselves a small shed to store things in (a big move up from the basement) and googled how to build a webpage. But we struggled to find a name for our store. Grandma’s Slightly Smoked On Hand Me Downs just wasn’t gonna fly. It was then my neighbor's dog stuck its head through our fence and yelled at me. Wall dog! Or just Waldog? waldog!</p>
                    <p className="info-text">And that's it. People started sending me all these wierd items so I started selling them. <span className="info-span">Buy our stuff!</span></p>
